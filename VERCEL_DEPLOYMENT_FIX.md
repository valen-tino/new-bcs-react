# Vercel Deployment Fix Guide

## üö® Issue Diagnosis
The 404 errors on Vercel were caused by **missing SPA (Single Page Application) routing configuration**. When users visit routes like `/cms` or `/login` directly, Vercel was looking for actual files/folders instead of letting React Router handle the routing.

## ‚úÖ Solutions Applied

### 1. Created `vercel.json` Configuration
This file tells Vercel to serve `index.html` for all routes, allowing React Router to handle client-side routing.

### 2. Added `public/_redirects` File
Backup configuration for SPA routing support.

### 3. Updated `vite.config.js`
Enhanced build configuration for optimal Vercel deployment.

### 4. Created `.vercelignore`
Optimizes deployment by excluding unnecessary files.

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix: Add Vercel SPA routing configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables in Vercel
1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to **Settings** > **Environment Variables**
4. Add these variables from your `.env` file:
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID`
   - `VITE_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID`

### Step 3: Redeploy
1. Go to **Deployments** tab in Vercel
2. Click **Redeploy** on the latest deployment
3. Wait for deployment to complete

### Step 4: Test Routes
After deployment, test these URLs:
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/` (Homepage)
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/cms` (CMS Dashboard)
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/login` (Login Page)
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/gallery` (Gallery Page)
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/testimonials` (Testimonials)
- `https://your-domain.vercel.app/announcements` (Announcements)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If 404 Errors Persist:
1. **Check Build Output**: Ensure `dist/` folder contains `index.html`
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Make sure all Firebase configs are set
3. **Check Build Command**: Should be `npm run build` or `vite build`
4. **Root Directory**: Ensure Vercel is deploying from the root directory

### If CMS Won't Load:
1. **Check Firebase Rules**: Ensure authentication is properly configured
2. **Verify Environment Variables**: Double-check Firebase configuration
3. **Check Browser Console**: Look for JavaScript errors
4. **Test Local Build**: Run `npm run preview` locally to test production build

### If Routes Don't Work:
1. **Clear Vercel Cache**: In deployment settings, try "Bypass Cache" deployment
2. **Check vercel.json**: Ensure the rewrite rule is correct
3. **Verify React Router**: Ensure all routes are properly defined in App.jsx

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] `vercel.json` file exists in root directory
- [ ] `public/_redirects` file exists
- [ ] Environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard
- [ ] Latest code is pushed to GitHub
- [ ] Vercel has redeployed the project
- [ ] All routes load without 404 errors
- [ ] CMS is accessible at `/cms` route
- [ ] Login page works at `/login` route

## üîê Security Notes

### Environment Variables
- Never commit `.env` file to GitHub
- All environment variables must be prefixed with `VITE_` for Vite to include them
- Set all Firebase configuration variables in Vercel dashboard

### Firebase Configuration
- Ensure Firebase project is properly configured
- Check Firestore security rules allow authenticated access
- Verify Authentication methods are enabled in Firebase Console

## üìû Support

If issues persist after following this guide:
1. Check Vercel deployment logs in the dashboard
2. Test the production build locally with `npm run preview`
3. Verify all environment variables are correctly set
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
